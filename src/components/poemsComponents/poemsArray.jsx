      "Past Ovid's yews of baleful shade,\nWhere dreams have gone to die:\nA river flows with waters fast,\nAnd on its banks sat I.\n\nHere voices float among the curls,\nAnd swirl o'er sand,\nAnd fight the swift forgetful churn:\nIt's here I dip my hand.\n\nPulling forth, not dreams, not hopes,\nNor futures yet to pass,\nBut rather days, and weeks, and months,\nAlways too short, too fast.\n\nHere, mem'ries flit and float away,\nDownstream from Hades' damned,- \nOf passion, love, deceit, and hate -\nBorn 'fore Fates cut the strand.\n\nAnd it would be simplicity\nTo wander from the shore\nTo wade in deep and surely drown\nIn all that came before.\n\nWhat gift could authors ask for, more,\nThan stories, endless, pure?\nBut could I return, to live mine own-\nFrom yon wet, wailing lure?\n\nI hear in whispers, yet then in shouts,\nAnd more, impassioned cries!\nWhat life contains, 'neath each new day,\nFrom set and then the rise!\n\nMust I resist to look ahead?\nTo force myself to wait?\nFor greyed hair to show such breadth,\nThe depth of wrinkled face?\n\nWhich life will I, then, leech to waves?\nWhich losses must I grieve?\nWhich heartbreak dies upon my lips?\nWhose heart upon my sleeve?\nWhat betrayal waits in hand I'd trust?\nWhose knife plunged in my back?\nWhich night I'd long would last 'till dawn?\nWhich day I'd wish my last?\nWhich sickness, plea'd to take me quick?\nWhich joy plea'd never end?\nWhich death of loved ones, plea'd be shared?\nWhich birth plea'd God to send?\n\nTo wait for hell is hell itself,\nThough wait, I fear, I must,\nFor memories not mine to take,\nWill turn mine own to dust.\n\n'But please,' I plead, with spirits grey,\nTheir lives, there, flow'n away,\n'Might mine life, too, resist decay,\nIn waters fast, where currents rage.'",

      "A hidden room, I've found, with shelves\nThat extend, it seems, for miles,\nWhere every tome contains a life:\nSome ending mid-sentence, an untimely death,\nYet others, too, not yet complete, of lives still left to live.\nEach word is hallowed, holy, there,\nNo volume worth more, or less, than any other,\nAnd wandering, there, between the stacks,\nI see the full slate of unexpected acts,\nHuman, and divine, in their expression.\nTales of war, alongside peace, alongside ruin,\nDespair laid bare, following ecstasy, preceding guilt,\nPain, murder, rape, genocide, in equal measure,\nTo love, sacrifice, selfless giving, nobility.\n'Twas among all of this diversity,\nNestled between kings and serfs alike,\nI found a book with cover, fading, cerulean,\nLetters embossed, in leather, black,\nThat spelled your name, inspiring\nFear, and curiosity, within my soul.\nWhat will I find within these ivory pages?\nWhat heroism, or villainy, or secret world\nKnown but to you?\nAm I worthy, even now, to know\nWhat line stops short, and where, and how?\nAnd could I bare to see the punctuation,\nWhere before existed only fleeting thoughts\nOf where, and how, and who, you are, now?\nIt is with resistance (though only feigned)\nThat I carefully open to chapter 1,\nAnd steel myself for secrets\nI was never meant to learn.\n\nI skip ahead, as nights, seemingly endless, spent\nTalking, just talking, as stars move overhead,\nHad taught me all there was to know\nOf you, before we met, when living began again.\nI found the day I left you there, and learned\nThe way you cried, breathless, as sobs, wracked your body,\nLong after the energy for tears had fled.\nPage after page, you broke down, day after day,\nWith no reason where, but rather, when\nYou remembered I would never return,\nWherever the memories found you.\nI wept with you, as coworkers, friends, startled\nFor your sudden, sodden cheeks, your wails.\nI prayed, as you did, they did too,\nThat the pain of my abandonment would fade.\nSo I read on, and on, and on,\nThrough therapy, trips to your mom's, a new pet,\nThe culling of every tiny thing from our, now your, home\nThat reminded you of me, that gave pause for fleeting thought,\nThat this was all a dream.\nI held my breath before every page turned,\nBracing for despair to take you so completely,\nTo cast you aside, as I did,\nAnd bid you lose your light.\nBut instead:\n\nOn each new page, a step was taken:\nSmall, unsteady, most often halting,\nBut a step it was, all the same.\nI met him when you did,\nIn a brief smile at the market,\nAnd watched the two of you connect, at dinner,\nSharing the hurt from your past losses,\nTears, preceding smiles, then tears again,\nAnd then laughter.\nI saw the moving truck loaded up\nWith all that you'd seen fit to keep,\nAnd watched your daughter scurry, over boxes,\nExploring the life you built together,\nHe, and her, and you.\nAnd I smiled when you smiled,\nAnd cried when still you cried,\nAnd cheered when after tears had fallen,\nYou'd dried your eyes and smiled still.\nI found all that I hoped find, there,\nBehind that fading cover, cerulean,\nThat you had kept living, moving, ever forward,\nNever whole, but always searching for wholeness.\nI never had the chance to say, to implore you,\nTo search for new love in my absence -\nThe cancer had taken my voice long before I could tell you:\nThat my love would endure this failing heart,\nAnd manifest, again, to find itself in yours,\nEven if the man who carried it to you had not my face.\nAnd it did, and at last,\nI found the unfinished line:\nNot of death,\nBut sweet, lovely life.",
