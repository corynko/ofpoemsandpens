    transcription:
      "I know my father\nThrough ink-stained hands and scent of parchment,\nThrough the scratch of pen and flicker of candlelight.\nI watch, enraptured, from the chair, just for me,\nAnd explore worlds, mine and mine alone.\nThat scribble, there - is that a river?\nOr a torrent of stardust, winding its way\nThrough the sky of a planet, far-off, forgotten.\nAnd this circle here, a lake?\nOr a yawning chasm, a portal\nTo depths undiscovered, unsafe, yet inviting nonetheless?\nI wonder if he's exploring too,\nBrow furrowed, glasses slowly moving down\nThe bridge of his nose.\nDoes he need them, there?\nOr does the journey through the wormhole\nCure his ailing eyes, straighten his back?\nCould he play with me, there, could he catch me,\nAs I bound over the cratered surface?\nCould we find her together, there, among the starlight,\nAnd would her hair still fall, soft, round her shoulders,\nThe color of Twin Suns, overhead?\nCould she play with us, there, as she once did,\nTogether, inseparable, eternal,\nBonded together, as the atoms in the soil?\nI know where I am, in this chair, just for me,\nAnd I know that he's there by the scratch of the pen,\nBut my eyes, always searching, in the candlelight's flicker:\nEach tiny mark made, is she there?",

    transcription:
      "The color in your mane has chipped,\nFading, as the last light of summer decays\nInto autumn's twilight.\nYour tired hooves still have life,\nThough with lesser lustre, longing\nFor the safety of the herd.\nBut the herd is gone, one by one, taken.\nWere they retired to quiet pastures, or thrown away?\nTreasured in memory, or left to decay?\nAnd what fate will befall you, the last,\nThe final, proud, prancing protector,\nRiding up, down, up, down,\nAlways in rhythm, riding round, circling\nA center, alight, aglow,\nEager children waiting to hear\nThe music, to see\nThe lights, the world,\nFrom higher than they'd ever been -\nHolding tight, arms wrapped around your neck,\nNow gray, then, brightest blue,\nWhile parents beam, taking life\nFrom the laughter of their loved ones.\nI watch, now, in grass overgrown:\nThere are no lights, no songs, no laughter,\nAs you are removed from your platform,\nCircling for the last time,\nAnd loaded into a dark truck, bound\nI know not where.\nBut when the door is once again lifted,\nI hope you are illuminated\nBy the summer sun, once again,\nAnd feel the joy of the gallop, evermore.",
